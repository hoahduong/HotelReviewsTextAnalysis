# HotelReviewsTextAnalysis

Reviews and ratings have revolutionized traditional word-of-mouth marketing into a viral form of feedback that can influence consumersâ€™ opinions. When we consider reviews and ratings, both businesses and consumers can benefit. Reviews help consumers voice their needs and act as a form of recommendation, a high-value social proof. Also, reviews help business owners to identify potential areas of improvement, measure overall customer satisfaction, and create micro-marketing campaigns1. With the constantly growing volume and variety of review data, effective analysis becomes of paramount importance.

Our project is based on reviews and rating analysis with a case study of hotels in the US. We seek to provide insights to both the customers and the hotel owners. We used data visualization and text mining techniques such as word clouds, NRC Sentiment Analysis, and Vader Analysis to explore the patterns and features from the dataset. Next, through feature engineering, we augmented roughly 28,000+ features from the raw review texts, which were later used as inputs to the predictive models. Finally, we built, tuned, and compared the performances of various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Bagging to categorize hotels based on the review texts.
